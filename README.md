# Daniel's Personal Portfolio

## About Me
Hello! My name is Ikechukwu Daniel Adebi, and I am a member of MIT's class of 2022, majoring in Computer Science and Physics. This is my portfolio of projects I've worked on over the years. All of my work on this github spans from 2017, all the way up til today, but I have been programming since 2013, when I was in eighth grade. Most of my work from that time has been lost, so for those projects, I'll simply describe what their purposes were and why I made them.

## My Projects 

### Poker Hand Classifier 
_Developed in July 2019_

#### Description 
This program is a neural network that is able to identify poker hands with over 99% accuracy. 
#### Reason for Development 
This is was the first time I created a neural network without following any tutorials online, and I was also curious to see how neural networks could guess 

### Stock Predictor 
*__Developed in June 2019__*

This is a machine learning model that takes in the prices of each stock in the S&P 500 and by using a support vector machine, predicts whether the prices will rise or fall and by how much. It can also determine whether or not you should buy, sell, or hold a stock for a certain timespan (default is 7 days) provided by the user.
